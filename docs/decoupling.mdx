# Decoupling

Decoupling splits the logic on a single location in Hydro across multiple locations by inserting `Network` operators, converting dataflow between streams into message passing.

Analysis is necessary before decoupling in order to determine:
1. The set of operators that can be decoupled, and
2. Each potential decoupling's impact on throughput and latency.

## Correctness
Decoupling within an atomic region (see [Ticks and Atomicity](../ticks-atomicity/)) would split operations meant to execute within a single unit of logical time across machines with incomparable logical time.
Without additional coordination between machines, this would violate safety.
We avoid these complications by only considering operators that are not within any atomic region.
By definition, these operators can tolerate any delays in processing, so the additional delay introduced by message passing does not affect behavior.


## Cost
Decoupling a single machine `A` into two machines `A` and `B` changes the CPU load on each machine as follows:

- The CPU load on `A` is reduced by the CPU load of the decoupled operators.
- The CPU load on `B` is the sum of the CPU load of the decoupled operators.
- For each operator on `A` that now sends a message to `B`, the CPU load on `A` is increased by the cost of serializing each output of the operator.
- For each operator on `A` that now sends a message to `B`, the CPU load on `B` is increased by the cost of deserializing each output of the operator.

The serialization and deserialization cost can be estimated after profiling, by multiplying the cardinality of the operator's output with the average cost of serialization and deserialization for each message.


## ILP
We model the decision of "which operators to decouple" as an Integer Linear Program (ILP).
Our objective is to minimize the CPU load on both the original and new machines, so neither of them are likely to remain the bottleneck.
For each decouple-able operator (according to [Correctness](#correctness)), we add a variable to the ILP that is `1` if the operator should be placed on the decoupled machine and `0` otherwise.
We adjust the CPU loads accordingly and add a serialization/deserialization penalty if the parent or child of the operator is located on a different machine.


## Rewriting the Program
Once the ILP is solved, Hydro implements the decoupling decisions by inserting `Network` operators between the decoupled operators and their parents and children.
Special care is taken to ensure that any references to `CLUSTER_SELF_ID` on the decoupled machine continues to refer to the ID of the original machine, as it would have before decoupling.
