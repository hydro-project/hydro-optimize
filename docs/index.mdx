# Optimizations
:::caution

Optimizations are an experimental feature.
The implementation is still evolving and may be incorrect.

:::

During compilation, Hydro programs can be automatically optimized with opt-in, provably safe rewrites.
These optimizations increase throughput by scaling up, by introducing **decoupling** (pipeline parallelism) and **partitioning** (data parallelism) to different components of the Hydro program.
Decoupling splits components into sub-components while partitioning splits data across replicas; both serve to allow bottlenecked nodes to split load across additional machines.

NaÃ¯vely decoupling and partitioning may split atomic regions or shared data across machines, requiring coordination in order to maintain consistency.
Minimizing communication overhead is the key to performant decoupling and partitioning; this is achieved through careful analysis (see [Decoupling](./decoupling.mdx) and [Partitioning](./partitioning.mdx) for more details).

:::info

Decoupling and partitioning are traditional optimizations first used to scale distributed protocols in the VLDB '21 paper [Scaling Replicated State Machines with Compartmentalization](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p2203-whittaker.pdf).
These techniques were then formalized into rule-driven rewrites in the SIGMOD '24 paper [Optimizing Distributed Protocols with Query Rewrites](https://hydro.run/papers/david-sigmod-2024.pdf) and extended to BFT protocols in the PaPoC '24 paper [Bigger, not Badder: Safely Scaling BFT Protocols](https://hydro.run/papers/david-papoc-2024.pdf).

## Correctness
These new machines together "represent" the original machine and are indistinguishable from the original to any observer, guaranteeing the **safety** of the rewrites.
Rewrites are safe if the optimized program always behaves in a way that the original Hydro program could have.

Fault tolerance, however, is a different matter.
Because each machine now executes independently, they also *fail* independently, whereas the original machine would have failed as a whole.
Therefore, these optimizations should only be correctly applied to protocols that permit the possibility of partial failures, or more formally, **general omission** (the potential loss of messages between any machine).
This includes core distributed protocols like Paxos and Raft and any BFT protocol.


## Profiling
Our optimizations work by reducing the load on bottlenecked machines, but bottlenecks in distributed systems vary based on the workload and execution environment.
Therefore, the first step in optimization is **profiling**, using a benchmark representative of the expected workload.
Once a benchmark is created, Hydro will automatically execute the program with the benchmark, analyze the results for optimization opportunities, and apply those optimizations.

An example benchmark for 2PC can be found in `two_pc_bench.rs`.
The 2PC client generates payloads for a fixed number of simulated users in a closed loop, creating the next payload when 2PC successfully commits the previous one.
The throughput, latency, and CPU usage of 2PC can then be automatically measured and used to determine the bottleneck.

:::tip

In order to opt into decoupling and partitioning, Hydro programs must be deployed with the `deploy_and_analyze` function.
You must also install perf locally. On Debian, this can be done by executing the following command: `sudo sh -c 'apt update && apt install -y linux-perf binutils && echo -1 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid && echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict'`.
